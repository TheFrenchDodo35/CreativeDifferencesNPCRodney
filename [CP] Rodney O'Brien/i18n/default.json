I know you are probably starstruck, but please, refrain from asking for an autograph.$1#$b#...#$b#Oh, you've never heard of me? Well that's a shame. Maybe try to pick up a book once in a while.$7#$b# Anyways. The name's Rodney. I'm Elliott's uncle. I live in East Scarp, in the old silo on the north-east. Pleasure to meet you @!$1",

  "spring_Mon8": "I really like to shop at Pierre's, especially since I have no sympathy towards Joja, but that man needs to lower some of its prices.$2#$b#200 $ for a bottle of vinegar is highway robbery considering you can get a full meal at the saloon like a salad for only 220 $ !$5",
  "spring_Mon10.Platonic": "The Egg Festival reminds me of my childhood. Of course, in Zuzu City, people would celebrate the Egg Festival in their private gardens. There was no city wide Egg Hunt.#$b#We had no garden when I was child, so my parents would hide eggs in every nook and cranny of our tiny apartment. I really loved it.$1",
  "spring_Tue": "I read a few pages of Elliott's first draft for his novel. It's pretty good!$1#$b#He didn't like it, though.$2#$b#He kept asking me to stop reading over his shoulder while he was writing.#$b#I mean, a professional writer offers to give him feedback for free, and he rejects it? That kid is so unappreciative.$5#$b#Who does he think he is to refuse the help of Rodney O'Brien, two-time Award winner of the best novel of the year at FernCon?$1",

  "spring_Tue6": "A writer's life is not a glamorous as most people believe.#$b#For example, last night I spent a couple hours researching laws regarding the zoning of agricultural areas in Stardew Valley.$2#$b#I needed it for a single sentence.$7",
  "spring_Tue8": "$d Joja #I told Pierre that I believed his prices were too high. You know what he said?#$b#'If you don't like it, you can shop elsewhere!'#$b#Does he really want to drive all his customers towards Joja Mart?$2|#I told Pierre that I believed his prices were too high. You know what he said?#$b#'If you don't like it, you can shop elsewhere!'#$b#He knows that Joja Mart is closed, right?$2",
  "spring_Tue10.Platonic": "I've told you I mostly write science fiction, but I did write a fantasy novel once. Even though it's not my favorite genre, I really enjoy it and I thought I could write a compelling story.#$b#I've never been so wrong.$2#$b#After hours of editing, I finally got it published. My publisher suggested that I use a pen name, because my audience was not used to this type of book.#$b#I should have listened to them. This novel received some pretty harsh critiques and I was bestowed the Worst Fantasy Novel of The Decade Award...$2#$b#This was the last time I did something outside of my comfort zone.$2",
  "spring_Wed": "I like to do a tarot spread for each season. I did one this morning to learn more about spring.$3#$q 860605/860606 tarot_followup#Tell me farmer @, do you believe in the power of the Tarot Cards?#$r 860605 10 tarot_yes#Yes!

That actually a common misconception.$4#$b#The Fool represents innocence and a free spirit. It's numbered zero: the number of unlimited potential.$1",
  "spring_Wed4": "I don't wanna brag, but...$4#$e#A few years ago, I was invited to the Queen Of Sauce's annual Garden Party. That's the first time I met her, and she's surprisingly down to Earth for such a famous woman.$1#$e#Gus reminds me of her, a bit. Or maybe, it's just his food.#$e#Great, now I'm hungry. Thank you very much @.$5",
  "spring_Wed6": "Spring in the Valley is so peaceful compared to what it's like in Zuzu City.#$b#In the city, every single park of the city became crowded with depressed office workers, partying students and noisy children every time the Sun would shine for more than thirty minutes.#$b#Ah, good times.$1",

  "spring_Thu2": "Do you watch Living off the Land? I find it quite fascinating. Not that I plan on living off the land anytime soon, I prefer shopping at Pierre's and eating at the saloon.#$b#But it provides me with some interesting research for my next book!$1",
  "spring_Thu4": "I had a call with my editor last night.#$b#They're not happy that my next book is gonna be mostly fantasy.$2#$b#See @, I usually write science-fiction, and I'm good at it. But, years ago I published a fantasy novel and let's say, it was far from successful.$2",
  "spring_Thu6": "I did a tarot reading last night, trying to figure you out.#$b#I discovered that you love %favorite. That an interesting choice.$3",
  "spring_Thu8": "This morning I did a tarot reading for the book I'm currently working on.$3#$b#It's a good way to define the personality of a character with a bit of magical randomness!$1",
  "spring_Thu10.Platonic": "Hey @, do you know what happens when you don't pay your exorcist?#$b#You get repossessed!$1#$e#Get it?",
  "spring_Fri": "It's kind of weird how quiet life is in the Valley. Back in Zuzu City, everyone seemed in a hurry all the time.#$b#Here, you can enjoy walking at your own pace, stopping to smell the flowers or talk to random people. I think I like it.$1",
  "spring_Fri2": "Spring in the Valley really is a special time, don't you agree @?#$b#It feels like everything fits perfectly together: nature, the people, the sun, the spirits...#$b#I love it.$1",
  "spring_Fri4": "I read online that they're doing a reboot of Stellar Gallivant...$2.#$b#Not gonna lie, I'm scared.$2.#$b#I'll watch every single minute of it, but I swear I'll be pissed the all time!$1",
  "spring_Fri6": "I heard that the producers of Stellar Gallivant heard the complaints of the fans online. Instead of a reboot, they're developing a new show based in the same timeline.#$b#I can't believe that complaining on the Internet actually worked, now I'll have to do it all the time!$1",
  "spring_Fri8": "So. They started airing the new Stellar Gallivant show.#$b#It's set a couple hundred centuries after the previous show. I was a bit skeptical, but it's pretty cool actually.#$b#They even added a character who's originally from the Gotoro Empire. That's a nice touch, especially since Stellar Gallivant has always been about peace and unity.$1",
  "spring_Fri10.Platonic": "Yesterday, I watched a documentary about the Fern Islands and now, I really want to visit again.$2#$b#Last time I went was on spring break when I was a student.#$b#Damn, I'm getting old.$2",
  "spring_Sat4": "I sent a beautifully handwritten letter to my daughter last week, telling her about my life in the Valley.#$b#You know what she did?#$b#She called me and asked me why I used such a primitive way to communicate with her!$5#$b#That hurt my feelings.$2#$b#Oh I'm still gonna write to her, just to piss her off.$1#$b#I'm such a good dad.",

Why wasn't she able to visit this place if nothing of value was in it?#$b#When she was about to give up and go back to bed, she noticed a crooked painting on the wall.

She finally managed to open it and then, it fell on the floor.#$b#Rays of light and sparkles flew out in every direction from the old tome. When everything settled, she closed the book, stuck it back in the vault and went straight to bed, pretending nothing happened.#$b#The next morning, a strange chicken-like creature came to her telling her she had released the power of the Clamp Arcanas on the world and she needed to catch them all to save the world and become the very best, like no one ever was.
