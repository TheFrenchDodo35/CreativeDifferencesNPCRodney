# Creative Differences - NPC Rodney O'Brien

This is the repository for a Stardew Valley mod. You can find the current public release on Nexusmods: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/13437

This mod adds a new NPC (Rodney) and some custom items. 

Feel free to plunder my code, just don't steal assets like sprites, music, etc.

## FAQ (WIP)

Can you make Rodney marriageable?
> No. Rodney is datable, but for story reasons that he will explain if you date him, you can marry him.

Can I date Rodney and other NPCs as the same time?
> Yes! You can toggle RodneyPolyamory to true in the mod's config.
> Please note that even with this option toggled on, you will not be able to date Rodney & Elliott at the same time (because they are related). I will not change that, so don't ask.

Can you lower the amount of autographs?
> If you are referring to the number of autographs visible in water, this is due to [Visible Fish]([https://pages.github.com/](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/8897). You can disable "Visible Trash" in the config of Visible Fish.

Rodney is too mean.
> This is not a question.
