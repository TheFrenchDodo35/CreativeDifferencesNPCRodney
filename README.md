# Creative Differences - NPC Rodney O'Brien

This is the repository for a Stardew Valley mod. You can find the current public release on Nexusmods: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/13437

This mod adds a new NPC (Rodney) and some custom items. 

Feel free to plunder my code, just don't steal assets like sprites, music, etc.

## Requirements

This mod requires:
- [East Scarp](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5787) (and all its dependencies). This is where Rodney lives!
- [SpaceCore](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1348). This mod uses a few of SpaceCore's features for custom items and additional event commands.
- [DaisyNiko's Tilesheets](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4736). Provides assets for various maps.
- [MEEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/14493) (optional, but recommended). This mod uses MEEP to display images in game (tarot cards mostly).

## Config options
**EnableAutograph**: Allows Rodney's autographed photo to spawn in the water and sometimes in artifact spots. Default to true.
**Silo**: Choose the style of Rodney's silo: vanilla style (default) or Yri (to match Yri's Project Yellog). Default to vanilla.
**RodneyPolyamory**: Choose whether you want Rodney to ask you out on a date when you are already in a relationship. Default is false. Note that you won't ever be able to date both Elliott & Rodney since they are related.

## Play guide
For details about heart events, gift tastes and more, you can check [Rodney's page on the East Scarp Wiki](https://eastscarp.wiki.gg/wiki/Rodney)


## Compatibility
- Compatible with Stardew Valley Expanded (NPCs from SVE have gift tastes & reactions for a few items added by this mod).
-    Compatible with Ridgeside Village (Rodney will attend the Ridgeside Gathering & The Ember of Resolution. He will also visit Ridgeside from time to time)
-    Compatible with Mobile Phone Continued.
-    Compatible with Romanceable Rasmodia - Female Wizard. If this mod is installed, Rodney & Ewina will now mention a witch instead of a wizard in their dialogue and events.
-    Compatible with Stardew Reimagined 3. Rodney has a dedicated schedule for the maps edited by this mod, but due to how the reimagined maps are layered, he may clip through benches from time to time. His schedule has been adjusted accordingly. Let me know if you find any issue.
-    As a part of East Scarp, Rodney will have something to say about what is going on in Never Ending Adventure, Yri The Architect, Always Raining in the Valley, Professor Jasper Thomas, Juliet & Jessie the Joja Clerks, Lavril, Lucikiel, Lurking in the dark, Fievel(including a crossover event), A New Dream and Nora The Herpetologist.
    He will also have dialogue if you have Juna, Realistic Writer Elliott, and More Conversation Topics.
-    Rodney will attend the following custom festivals: Fireworks Festival, Surfing Festival, Love Festival& Ferngill Fashion Festival. He will also attend the Marketpalooza Festival from the  Passerby Cemetery mod and he will have a shop there.

## FAQ

> Where does Rodney live?
He lives in the silo in East Scarp. It is located on the north east of East Scarp's Main area.

Can you make Rodney marriageable?
> No. Rodney is datable, but for story reasons that he will explain if you date him, you can't marry him.

Can I date Rodney and other NPCs as the same time?
> Yes! You can toggle RodneyPolyamory to true in the mod's config.
> Please note that even with this option toggled on, you will not be able to date Rodney & Elliott at the same time (because they are related). I will not change that, so don't ask.

Can you lower the amount of autographs?
> If you are referring to the number of autographs visible in water, this is due to [Visible Fish](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/8897). You can disable "Visible Trash" in the config of Visible Fish.
> If you are referring to the number of autographs you've been fished, you can disable AutotographSpawning in this mod's config.

What can I do with Rodney's autograph?
> You can recycle it in the recycling machine to get some useful material (cloth) or even a rare and much more valuable version of the autograph. It is also a liked and loved item for several modded NPCs. Or do what I do, give it to Lewis just to annoy him.

Are there other NPCs planned for this mod?
> I am working on the full mod called "The Writer, The Witch & The Wardrobe Assistant". It will add Rodney's daughter, Meredith, and his grandmother, Edwina. The full mod will also feature a retired pirate captain, the curator of the Ferngill National Library, the groundskeeper of this library and an undetermined amount of witches.

Can I get a version of this mod which doesn't require east Scarp?
> No.

Can I make on myself then?
> Nope.

Rodney is too mean.
> This is not a question.
